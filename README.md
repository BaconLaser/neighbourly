# neighbourly
an open source, peer to peer based approach to security for individuals, families, farms, businesses and communities.

vision 
a collection of hardware designs with associated software, legal agreements, understandings, governance and cooperation models that enable deployment of a security solution that allow a community to provide security monitoring at near zero cost.

Design principles
Drive to zero: (these are the goals - as asymptotes they will not be acheivable, only approachable.)
  zero crime: be effective in not only detecting and alerting on crimes, but actively assist in crime prevention and stolen property recovery.  
  zero pollution: drive designs towards zero energy use: ie energy efficiency and self contianed power (eg solar cell and recharable batteries) 
  zero marginal cost: adding more users to the network will further reduce the effort and expense of all participants.
  zero centralization: no chokepoints in the solution where someone could extract rent from monopolistic control.
  zero setup cost: the solution involves open commodity componenets, such that a clever person with a screwdrive and soldering iron could replicate the solution from a scrap yard. 
  
free hardware: all hardware used in the solution should be easily and cheaply available. ie the hardware used is free from restrictive proprietary licencing that drives up costs. the hardware is easily and reliably available from multiple suppliers such that it is a common commodity. 
free software: all software is free and open source
community cloud: the design should drive all functions: storage, analysis, security, notification, networking as close to the edges of the solution as possible to minimize costs, avoid centralization, and provide self-reliance.


Business models:
Freemium services: all components will be open and free to copy, modify and improve: participants can build income streams by providing kits, or assembled systems, installation, and/or enhanced services. 

Privacy: Privacy is a critical component to the soltuion. no one wants to live under a pan-opticon. 
  all data should be encrypted (eg  AlwaysEncrypted) such that only the end user of the deployed solution can access it. 
  the end user then controls the ruleset under which circumstances their data may be decrypted.
  
Redundant security:
  Shard and replicate the encrypted data to other nodes for protection from dataloss. 

use cases:
farm site monitoring
  gates: open/closed
  access: visitors/trespassors
  cameras and ai to detectvisitors/trespassors
  cell phone: any unexpected cell phones or other devices? 
  vehicle trackimg: track for vehicle access
  alert owners, neighbours when intruders detected.
  asset and inventory tracking: tag items with active and passive RFID/BLE/wifi/other tags; monitor location: detect and alert on unexpected conditions.
    forgetful farmer: where did I leave my board strether?
     theft detection: tagged asset moves unexpectedly
     recovery: track asset to assist in recovery
    
  
cabin
  monitor and alert on vacation properties. alert neighbours and local authourities

bicycles
  monitor and alert on unexpected movement
  recovery: track asset to assist in recovery

bands
  tag and track equipment
  monitor and alert on unexpected movement
  recovery: track asset to assist in recovery
